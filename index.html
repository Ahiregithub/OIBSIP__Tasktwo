        <h2>Biography</h2>
        <p>
            Steven Paul Jobs (February 24,1955 – October 5,2011) was an American business magnate, inventor, and investor. 
            He was the co-founder, chairman, and CEO of Apple; the chairman and majority shareholder of Pixar; a member of 
            The Walt Disney Company's board of directors following its acquisition of Pixar; and the founder, chairman,and 
            CEO of NeXT. He was a pioneer of the personal computer revolution of the 1970s and 1980s,along with his early 
            business partner and fellow Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak.</p>
            <p>Steve Jobs was a computer designer, executive and innovator, as well as an all-around role model for many people
            in their professional and personal lives.As the co-founder of Apple Computers and the former chairman of Pixar 
            Animation Studios, he revolutionized the computer and animation industries, amassing a fortune worth $10.2 billion
            at the time of his death.Jobs died at age 56 in Palo Alto, California, after battling pancreatic cancer for eight years.
        </p>
        <p>Woz, whose interest in electronics had grown stronger, was regularly attending meetings of a group of early computer hobbyists called the Homebrew Computer Club. They were the real pioneers of personal computing, a collection of radio jammers, computer professionals and enlightened amateurs who gathered to show off their latest prowess in building their own personal computer or writing software. The club started to gain popularity after the Altair 8800 personal computer kit came out in 1975.

            The knowledge that Woz gathered at the Homebrew meetings, as well as his exceptional talent, allowed him to build his own computer board — simply because he wanted a personal computer for himself. Steve Jobs took interest, and he quickly understood that his friend's brilliant invention could be sold to software hobbyists, who wanted to write software without the hassle of assembling a computer kit. Jobs convinced Wozniak to start a company for that purpose: Apple Computer was born on April 1, 1976.</p>
